# MD2MAN 1 2013-03-10 1.6.0

## NAME

md2man - convert markdown(7) into roff(7)

## SYNOPSIS

`md2man` [*OPTION*]... [*FILE*]

## DESCRIPTION

[md2man] converts markdown(7) input from the given *FILE* into roff(7) using
[Redcarpet] and then prints the result to the standard output stream.  If
*FILE* is not given, then the standard input stream is read in its place.

### Document format

md2man extends markdown(7) syntax in the following ways, as provisioned in the
`Md2Man::Document` module and defined in its derivative `Md2Man::Roff` module:

  * Paragraphs whose lines are all uniformly indented by two spaces are
    considered to be "indented paragraphs".  They are unindented accordingly
    before emission as `.IP` in the roff(7) output.

  * Paragraphs whose subsequent lines (all except the first) are uniformly
    indented by two spaces are considered to be a "tagged paragraphs".  They
    are unindented accordingly before emission as `.TP` in the roff(7) output.

md2man extends markdown(7) semantics in the following ways:

  * The first top-level heading (H1) found in the document is emitted as `.TH`
    in the roff(7) output to define the UNIX manual page's header and footer.
    Any subsequent top-level headings (H1) are treated as second-level (H2).

### Markdown extensions

The following [Redcarpet] extensions are enabled while processing markdown(7):

  * tables
  * autolink
  * superscript
  * strikethrough
  * fenced\_code\_blocks
